msgid "Welcome to Three Guys! Click to see the next tip."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your goal on each level is to collect the diamond. You must get Red Guy to the diamond to pick it up."
msgstr ""

msgid "To move Red, draw a path from him to the diamond. He will then pick it up."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your path can move in 4 directions, but not diagonals. To remove a path step, simply move back over it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your path also cannot cross itself, and must be one complete motion. Try it now."
msgstr ""

msgid "To see options and tips press the Escape key."
msgstr ""

msgid "That purple thing is a pushable block. It's rather heavy, but luckily Green has been going to the gym a lot recently, and can move it."
msgstr ""

msgid "To push the block, draw a path into it. The block will move so along as there is a free space for it to move into."
msgstr ""

msgid "With careful planning, a block can be moved a considerable distance in a single motion. Try it now."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note: pushblocks cannot be pulled, so be careful not to move it into a corner, or you'll need to restart the level and try again."
msgstr ""

msgid "Yellow Guy is here! Yellow Guy can build bridges over gaps, using his tools."
msgstr ""

msgid "To create a bridge, simply walk over a gap, and Yellow will automatically create it."
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of tools you have is shown at the bottom of the screen. Be careful not to run out."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some levels contain traps. In this case, spike traps lie in wait. Tread carefully."
msgstr ""

msgid "Spike traps can be destroyed by pushing a block over them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Often, walls and other obstacles will block your path."
msgstr ""

msgid "Try navigating Red to the diamond, by drawing a path from him to it, avoiding the walls."
msgstr ""

msgid "A pressure plate. It activates certain objects when it is weighed down. In this case, it will drop the wall between the Guys and the diamond."
msgstr ""

msgid "To weigh down the pressure plate, simply move one of the Guys on top of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Push blocks can also be used to weigh down pressure plates."
msgstr ""

msgid "Moving platforms move until they hit something solid."
msgstr ""

msgid "This platform is static right now, and will start moving when Red stands on it. It will move in the direction Red was going."
msgstr ""

msgid "Red must walk with it to avoid falling off, and keep walking in the same direction until it is safe to get off."
msgstr ""

msgid "As always, with careful planning, a moving platform can be guided around a level in a single motion."
msgstr ""

msgid "Beware of holes. If you attempt to move across any gaps, you will fall in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Draw your paths around the holes to avoid sending Red on his way to oblivion."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you mess up, you will have to retry."
msgstr ""

msgid "Crumbling floors will become unstable when you step on them, and collapse when you move off them. A hole will be left behind that could block your path."
msgstr ""

msgid "Walk up to the diamond. The floor behind will disappear as you leave it. You should take care not to maroon yourself."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pushblocks can also be used to destroy walls, by placing them on top of the space they occupied, and then allowing them to rise again."
msgstr ""

msgid "Two Guys! Red and Green. Click on a Guy to change to them. Each Guy controls the same way."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each Guy has their own unique ability, which you'll learn more about later."
msgstr ""

msgid "The important thing to know now is that Guys cannot pass one another when walking, and only Red can collect the diamond."
msgstr ""

msgid "You have some TNT! It can be used to destroy walls, and grant the Guys access to areas that were previously out of reach."
msgstr ""

msgid "To use TNT, simply click on a wall that you wish to destroy. The amount of TNT you have remaining is displayed below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Try using the TNT now to get to the diamond."
msgstr ""

msgid "One last thing: you have a limited number of moves."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can see the number of moves you have left in the top right of the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid "When you run out of moves, you fail the level, and must try again."
msgstr ""

msgid "Try and complete this level in 1 move."
msgstr ""

msgid "A teleporter! These can be used to transmit Guys (and other objects) to another location."
msgstr ""

msgid "Walk into the teleporter to bypass the wall and grab the diamond."
msgstr ""

msgid "Caution: when using teleports, keep in mind that anything at the receiving end might be destroyed by the incoming object ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Push blocks can also be put through teleporters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Laser traps create beams that cross the level until they hit something. Walking a Guy into the beams will blow the Guy up, so be careful!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Laser traps can be disabled or enabled by using pressure plates. Try it now."
msgstr ""

msgid "Laser beams can also be blocked by Push Blocks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Keys can be used to open doors. You can draw a path through a door with or without a key. The door will only open if you have a key, however."
msgstr ""

msgid "Walking over a key will pick it up. Note: you can only carry one key at a time, and cannot drop it once you have it. The only way to dispose of a key is to use it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh no, a fire pit trap! These cannot be walked over, but can be extinguished by pushing a pushblock into them, creating a walkable floor space."
msgstr ""

msgid "The down side is that the pushblock will be destroyed in the process. Try it now."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fire pit traps may also be invisible until a Guy steps on them, or a pushblock is pushed over them."
msgstr ""

msgid "The red area can only be walked on by the Red Guy. Yellow areas by Yellow, and green areas by Green."
msgstr ""

msgid "Plan carefully, so that you don't get stuck."
msgstr ""
