OpenTitus uses the OPL (adlib) emulator found in chocolate-doom (libopl.a). It is included, pre-compiled, in this source package. If you want to compile the emulator yourself, download chocolate-doom source (1.6.0), replace dbopl.c with the one in this folder (it contains a small bugfix around the abort() calls to prevent the emulator to crash when a percussion instrument is playing), compile it, move opl/libopl.a to this folder, rename it to libopl_*.a, compile OpenTitus and enjoy!

For win32/mingw/msys compiling, it might be tricky to get SDL_Mixer up and running. Simply download SDL_mixer devel-VC, rename SDL_mixer.lib to libSDL_mixer.a and move it to MinGW/lib/libSDL_mixer.a. Copy include/SDL_mixer.h to MinGW/include/SDL/SDL_mixer.h.

The compiled emulator should be placed as follow:
win32: libopl_win32.a
linux: libopl_linux.a
dingux; libopl_dingux.a
